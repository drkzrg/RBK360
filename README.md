# RBK360

A program that turns inputs from an Xbox 360 Rock Band 3 keyboard into MIDI inputs or keystrokes.

## WIP Notice

This program is a work-in-progress. Much work needs to be done before things will be functional.

## Tasks

Essentials:

- [ ] Raw report function for OpenXInput
- [ ] Keyboard report reading
- [ ] Keypress/MIDI output

Quality-of-life:

- [ ] User interface
- [ ] Customizable mappings for keypress/MIDI output

## Research

The inputs of the keyboard are documented in the [docs/Xbox 360 Keyboard Inputs.md](doc/Xbox%20360%20Keyboard%20Inputs.md) file. Some things may be incorrect, but everything is documented to the best of my knowledge.
